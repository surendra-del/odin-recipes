    <h3>A Comforting and Healing Drink: Haldi ka Doodh (Turmeric Milk)</h3>
    <p>
        Haldi ka doodh, also known as turmeric milk or golden milk, is a traditional Indian drink that has been enjoyed for centuries 
        for its healing and soothing properties. It is made by simmering milk with turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, and honey 
        until it is infused with the flavors and nutrients of the spices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turmeric, which is the main ingredient in haldi ka doodh, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It 
        contains a compound called curcumin, which has been shown to help reduce inflammation and improve brain function. Black pepper, 
        which is often added to the drink, helps to increase the bio availability of curcumin in the body.
