    <h3>Delicious and Creamy Indian Dish: Butter Chicken</h3>
    <p>
        Butter chicken is a popular Indian dish that consists of tender chicken pieces cooked in a creamy, mildly spiced tomato-based sauce. 
        The chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and lemon juice, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. 
        It is then grilled or baked until it is perfectly cooked and has a slightly charred exterior.
    </p>

        The sauce is made by simmering tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and spices in butter until they are soft and fragrant. 
        Cream or cashew paste is then added to create a rich and creamy texture. The grilled chicken pieces are then added to the sauce and cooked until 
        they are fully coated and infused with the flavors of the sauce.
